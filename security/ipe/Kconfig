	  This option enables the Integrity Policy Enforcement LSM
	  allowing users to define a policy to enforce a trust-based access
	  control. A key feature of IPE is a customizable policy to allow
	  admins to reconfigure trust requirements on the fly.

	depends on DM_VERITY
	help
	  This option enables the 'dmverity_roothash' property within IPE
	  policies. The property evaluates to TRUE when a file from a dm-verity
	  volume is evaluated, and the volume's root hash matches the value
	  supplied in the policy.

config IPE_PROP_DM_VERITY_SIGNATURE
	bool "Enable support for dm-verity based on root hash signature"
	depends on DM_VERITY && DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG
	help
	  This option enables the 'dmverity_signature' property within IPE
	  policies. The property evaluates to TRUE when a file from a dm-verity
	  volume, which has been mounted with a valid signed root hash,
	  is evaluated.

	  If unsure, answer Y.

config IPE_PROP_FS_VERITY
	bool "Enable support for fs-verity based on file digest"
	depends on FS_VERITY
	help
	  This option enables the 'fsverity_digest' property within IPE
	  policies. The property evaluates to TRUE when a file is fsverity
	  enabled and its digest matches the supplied digest value in the
	  policy.

	  if unsure, answer Y.

config IPE_PROP_FS_VERITY_BUILTIN_SIG
	bool "Enable support for fs-verity based on builtin signature"
	depends on FS_VERITY && FS_VERITY_BUILTIN_SIGNATURES
	help
	  This option enables the 'fsverity_signature' property within IPE
	  policies. The property evaluates to TRUE when a file is fsverity
	  enabled and it has a valid builtin signature whose signing cert
	  is in the .fs-verity keyring.

	  if unsure, answer Y.
